## Context

Each person, in the course of life, encounters numerous inconsequential events. Other events change lives. Among these life changing events are synchronicity and serendipity.

Awareness of meaningful coincidences is increasing in Western culture as people search for meaning in their increasingly chaotic lives. Synchronicity and serendipity can help individuals find thier life purpose; accelerate their spiritual, psychological, and interpersonal development; and serve practical functions in their work and domestic lives.

According to You.com, the increased interest in meaningful coincidences within Western culture can be attributed to several factors. Many individual have had personal experiences of coincidences that they find meaningful or significant. These experiences can spark curiosity and a design to explore the nature and potential explanations for such events. Meaningful coincidences offer a sense of connection, purpose, and a belief in something beyond random chance. The study of meaningful coincidences intersects with psychology and the exploration of human cognition and perception. Understanding how the mind perceives and assigns meaning to coincidences can shed light on broader psychological processes and the nature of consciousness. Western culture encompasses a wide range of spiritual and transpersonal beliefs. Meaningful coincidences are often seen as signs or synchronistic events that reflect a deeper interconnectness or a higher order. Exploring these phenomena can align with spiritual or metaphysical beliefs. The interdisciplinary nature of studying meaningful coincidences fosters dialog and collaboration among researchers, scholars, and practitioners from various fields. This cross pollination of ideas and perspectives contributes to the growing interest and exploration of these phenomena.

As people become more familiar with meaningful coincidences, they search for ways to increase them. Knowing common coincidence patterns may allow people to recoginze and use coincidences. While many relevant patterns can be abstracted from reading and hearing numerous stories, machine learning models offer the opportunity to more sharply define and outline how coincidences might be useful.

From a more global perspective, identifying coincidence patterns can reveal thought patterns common to many people which then can be used to formulate ways in which to modulate our current tendency toward self and environmental destruction.

## Opportunity System Will Address

Knowing patterns of meaningful coincidences will allow study of patterns of meaningful coincidences. One anecdote is one anecdote. Several similar anecdotes suggest a pattern. Several thousand or more meaningful coincidences have been reported in a range of media including news outlets, television, books, academic papers, and social media. Serendipity has stimulated the creation of the Serendipity Society dedicated to the academic study of serendipity. Meaningful coincidences emphasizing synchronicity has stimilated the creation of the Coincidence Project. These phenomena are ready for the first stage in the creation of a formal science of patterns of meaningful coincidences.

This predictor will take a giant step toward determining the usefulness of and explanations for meaningful coincidences. As patterns of meaningful coincidences are more clearly elucidated, individuals will discover that what they might think is unique to them is more realistically part of a shared human experience. This will make possible developing communication links among people with similar coincidence experiences. This will lead to an experience of interconnection among and between people who would have never met without those links. One of the fundamental implication of coincidences is that we are more interconnected than modern thought currently excepts.

The realization of interconnectedness can lead to stronger group efforts to confront the threats to humans' existence. We anticipate the recognition of a collective human mind. Predicted coincidence patterns will articulate basic patterns of human thought in ways that promise to bring humans together to confront crises humans are creating.

We expect that predicting patterns of meaningful coincidences will lead to determining the usefulness of meaningful coincidences and hypotheses about how meaningful coincidences are formed. Knowing how meaningful coincidences are useful could itself be used to develop guidelines for individuals seeking to understand how to use meaningful coincidences. We anticipate the development of ethically formed and scientifically based suggestions for individuals to consider when they wonder how to use their meaningful coincidences.

This predictor may be monetized in apps and other means of connecting people and suggesting how meaningful coincidences may be used.

## What System Will Do

This predictor will predict based on two primary elements of meaningful coincidences. These elements are a Mental Event and an External Event. The result of the predictor will be a Pattern.

Definitions are important. Several books illustrate how science, particularly pharmacology, advances one serendipity at a time. Many more books highlight the usefulness of synchronicity. Yet the definitions of these terms has been widely debated. As a result they are not clearly defined. We consider below some definitions.

A Phenomenon is an observable fact. A Phenomenon may be a Mental Phenomenon or a Physical Phenomenon.

A Mental Phenomenon is a thought, feeling, emotion, sensation, or image. A Mental Phenomenon is private to an individual. A Mental Phenomenon may be a group of other Mental Phenomena.

A Physical Phenomenon is something that can be proved deductively to exist assuming that the experiences of sight, sound, touch, smell, and taste and the words of people are generally consistent and true. Each Physical Phenomenon has a form and a shape. A Physical Phenomenon can be a person, an animal, a plant, an inanimate object, the ink that forms a word in a book, light that forms a word on a screen, speech, music, light that forms an image in a video or movie, a scene in a play, a painting, or a drawing. A Physical Phenomenon can be a lost or needed object like a key or a dollar bill. A physical phenomenon may be a machine, a divining card, an animal entrail, or a tea leaf. A physical phenomenon may be a group of other physical phenomena.

An Event is an emergence of one or more Mental Phenomena or Physical Phenomena.

A Mind Event is an emergence of one or more Mental Phenomena. A Mind Event is private to an individual. A Mind Event may cause an External / Object Event.

An External / Object Event is an emergence of one or more Physical Phenomena. An External / Object Event is an event outside an individual's mind. An External / Object Event occurs in the public sphere so that someone else could possibly observe it.

A Pattern is a connection between two Events that applies to multiple pairs of Events.

A coincidence is a pair of a Mind Event and a Mind Event, a Mind Event and an External / Object Event, or an External / Object Event and an External / Object Event.

A synchronicity is a coincidence.

A meaningful coincidence is a coincidence that is remembered by a person.

A serendipity is a coincidence that benefits a person.

## Iterations Of Development

At the end of Iteration...

1. This System will be able to receive a pair of a description of a Mind Event and a description of an External / Object Event and predict a description of a Pattern.

    Here is an example of an External / Object Event. "A close friend of mine was returning by plane ro San Francisco after attending his father's tombstone unveiling on the East Coast. He was a few months away from finishing his psychiatric residency and had little idea about where to go and what to do after finishing. His future was wide open and blank. In those days, seats on airplanes were assigned, not personally selected. Seated in the same row was a young woman who asked him what time it was, even though she had a big watch on her wrist. She was returning from Chicago after an extended visit with her father. My friend and this woman found much in common. A few months later they moved together to Portland, Oregon, where she was going to graduate school. He simply wanted to go with her and have the freedom to paint. After a while, he found a psychiatric job there. They were married, had two children, and were together for forty years until they separated."

    Here is an example of a Mind Event. "At the time when they had met, each had in mind a readiness to find a permanent someone and an image in mind of that permanent someone."

    Here is an example of a Pettern. "An image in mind matches the object. What you are seeking is seeking you."
